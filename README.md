# Modal Window

In this project, i build a simple but interactive modal window feature where a user can open a centered pop-up by clicking one of several “Show Modal” buttons. The modal appears on top of the screen with a dark, blurred overlay behind it, and it can be closed in three different ways: by clicking the close button (×), clicking outside on the overlay, or pressing the Escape key on the keyboard. The JavaScript handles all user interactions by toggling the '.hidden' class to show or hide the modal and overlay. Multiple buttons use the same event listener through a loop, and clean reusable functions manage opening and closing the modal.
